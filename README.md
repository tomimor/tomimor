### Web3 Product Manager, now coding my way into product engineering

From business economics to building digital products â€” my journey hasn't been traditional. 

I have always been **curious** & **doer**. 

I like to **solve problems** & **build**.

With Economics & Finance as my university foundation, I spent the last 5 years in the trenches of **product management** in **finance & crypto startups**.

I developed a **product mindset** & **business acumen** that allows me to understand the needs of the users & the challenges of the engineering team with an entrepreneurial mindset.

Doing that I discovered what drives me: **creating products that simplify complex challenges** with a **team of talented people**.

...and after years of working closely with engineering, design & business teams, I realized I wanted to get more involved in the actual coding.

Now I'm bridging my **product & business mindset** with **technical skills** to become a **product engineer** ðŸš€
